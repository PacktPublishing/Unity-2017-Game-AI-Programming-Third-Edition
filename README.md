# Unity 2017 Game AI Programming Third Edition
This is the code repository for [Unity 2017 Game AI Programming Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/unity-2017-game-ai-programming-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788477901), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This third edition will help you break down Artificial Intelligence into simple concepts to give you a fundamental understanding of the topic to build upon. Using a variety of examples, the book then takes those concepts and walks you through actual implementations designed to highlight key concepts, and features related to game AI in Unity.
### Instructions and Navigations
All of the codes are organized as per the chapters, each folder has all the asset files related to that.                   
For example: Unity2017GameAIProgrammingThirdEdition_Code\Chapter02

Following is the software list:

| Chapter       | Software required
| ------------- | -------------
| 02-08         | Unity 2017.x 
|               | Visual Studio

              
To install Unity just follow these steps:
1. Head over to https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download and download  the installer.
2. When prompted to select a version, you can choose to use the Personal Edition for educational purposes, or you may opt for the Plus or Pro versions if you meet the criteria.
3. Once you run the installer you'll be prompted to accept the Unity license.
4. Eventually, you'll be prompted to select the components you wish to use. At this point you can install any components you want to use, but this book doesn't require anything special. The sample projects include the necessary files and code to follow along.
5. The installer will walk you through the rest of the steps, and if you're on Windows, you'll also be prompted to install Visual Studio Community. We highly recommend you do so, as it is our IDE of choice. You are free, however, to use any IDE you're comfortable with.
